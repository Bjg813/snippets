## My Code Snippets

This *repo* is for myself and anyone who wants to see my slowly evolving repo of code snippets

I found having this repo is really helpful in learning [git](https://git-scm.com/), [github](https://github.com/), and [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)!

If this helps anyone learning **git**, awesome :bowtie:.
If anyone has found something wrong or can add to my evolving list, please write an **issue** or *clone* or display the bat signal :mega:, and I will be there!
