## My Code Snippets

This *repo* is for myself and anyone who wants to see my slowly evolving repo of code snippets.

This repo is helpful with learning [git](https://git-scm.com/), [github](https://github.com/), and [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)!

If this helps anyone's learning curve with  **git**, the awesome sauce :bowtie:.
If anyone has found something wrong or can add to my evolving list, please write an *issue* or *clone* or display the * bat signal* :mega:, and I will be there!
